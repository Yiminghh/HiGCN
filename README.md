The simplicial complexes (SCs) are a powerful tool to model higher-order interactions with elegant and potent mathematical tools. 
We creatively construct a higher-order **flower-petals (FP) model** and introduce **FP Laplacians** to study SCs.
Additionally, we propose a higher-order graph convolutional network (**HiGCN**) based on the FP Laplacians, which can capture intrinsic topology features at different scales.





# Prerequisites:
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```
pytorch
pytorch-geometric
networkx
numpy
```
# Exp1: Node Classification 
go to folder `./node_classify/src`

## Run experiment with Cora:


```sh
cd node_classify/src
python run_node_exp.py --RPMAX 100 \
        --net HiGCN \
        --dataset cora \
        --lr 0.1 \
        --alpha 0.5 \
        --weight_decay 0.001 \
        --dprate 0.3
```

Before the training commences, the script will download and preprocess the respective graph datasets. 
Subsequently, it performs the appropriate graph-lifting procedure (this process might a while).





## Create null model for dataset Texas:
For academic confidentiality, we can't release the code which is used to generate the null model, 
so we publish the edge list of each null model in the folder `nullModel_Texas` under `data` folder.

If you want to run null model dataset, just change Dataset name as Texas_null and choose rho in 
`['-0.5', '-0.4', '-0.3', '-0.2', '-0.1', '0.1', '0.2', '0.3', '0.4', '0.5']` (mentiond: `--rho` need to be string)
`rho=0.5` means the network has 50% plus triangles of the origin network.

```sh
python train_model.py --RPMAX 100 --net HiGCN --dataset Texas_null --lr 0.1 --alpha 0.5 --weight_decay 0.001 --dprate 0.3 --rho='0.1'
```

# Exp2: graph classification
go to folder `./graph_classify`

We prepared individual scripts for each experiment. The results are written in the
`exp/results/` directory and are also displayed in the terminal once the training is
complete. 
```shell
cd graph_classify
sh scripts/HiGCN-PROETINS.sh
```



# Exp3: simplicial data imputation
go to folder `./CoSCs`


The results will be displayed in the terminal. 
To run an experiment on coauthor complexes with HiGCN, execute the following command:
```shell
cd CoSCs
sh CoSCs-HiGCN.sh
```
